# Machine Learning Roadmap

A comprehensive guide to Machine Learning Algorithms with Theory, Math and Code.

# Overview
This repository serves as a structured collection of Machine Learning concepts, including data analysis, supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms, and neural networks. Each section contains Jupyter Notebooks with detailed explanations, mathematical derivations, and Python implementations using libraries like scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch.

I have written detailed Medium articles to supplement this repository, explaining the concepts further. If you're looking to learn ML deeply, prepare for technical interviews, or apply these algorithms in real-world projects, this repository is for you.
